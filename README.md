# ADA Website

## Requirements

To run build and serve the website, install **zola** from [https://github.com/getzola/zola/releases](https://github.com/getzola/zola/releases) and place the binary in the root of this repo.

## Run the Website

Use the [zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/cli-usage/) binary to test the website locally:

```{bash}
./zola serve
```

In order to build the website without a local server, use

```{bash}
./zola build
```
